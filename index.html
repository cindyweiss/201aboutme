    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my Code 102 bio page! My name is Vik Akam, and I'm a long time Seattle resident. I graduated from the
      University of Washington in 2016 with a degree in Biochemistry. It wasn't until around March of 2019 that I
      re-aligned my interests, from health care and medicine, toward the computer science field. It's been a roller
      coaster ride of both over-confident highs and gut-wrenching lows, but I'm ecstatic to see what challenges this
      transition beteween industries brings.</p>
